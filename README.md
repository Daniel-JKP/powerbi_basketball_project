# powerbi_basketball_project

In this project, I explore different measures within offense, defense and champions in NCAA men's college basketball. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset. 

It also marks my first independent project examining something of personal interest i.e. sports and in paticular basketball. Importing the data and cleaning the data making it suitable for Power BI took some effort with regards to formatting or changing data types without messing up decimal places etc. as well as replacing values for Postseason placement with the intention of making the designations more intuitive/understandable (e.g. F4 -> Final Four). 

The EDA itself challenged some common basketball notions e.g. that faster playing teams are more efficient (scoring more points). This did not turn out to be the case as the correlation was -0.1. On the last page, I reveal some of the insights of the analysis of the champions - for instance that rebounding on both end of the floor is a common strength among the ones last standing.
